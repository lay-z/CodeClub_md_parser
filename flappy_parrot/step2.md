**Step 1:** Make Flappy fall {.activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Start a new Scratch project. Delete the cat by right-clicking it and selecting Delete
+ Replace the background with an outdoor landscape. **desert** is a good choice.
+ Add the Flappy character. You'll need a sprite with costumes for wings up and wings down. **parrot** is a good choice.
+ Change the name of your sprite to __Flappy__.
+ Give Flappy the following script:
```blocks
    when FLAG clicked
        go to x: (-50) y: (0)
        forever
            change y by (-3)
```

## Test Your Project { .flag}

__Click the green flag__, does Flappy start in the middle of the screen and then fall to the bottom?

## Save your project { .save}
